I've always been pleased with the car wash, and it's never taken too terribly long. But I took my car there last week, and I finally had an encounter with the man trying to sell windshields. My car is two years old and my windshield doesn't even have one rock chip in it! It is in perfect condition! He was really pushy, saying how my windshield is dangerous and asking for the name of my insurance company (seriously!). Well, I've now lost all respect for Classic Car Spa after that happened. Why would a reputable business be associated with a snake oil salesman? I won't be going back after my groupon car washes run out."}

When you walk in, to your right you will order at the counter and get a number to put on your table for delivery.  They have booths, a long wooden family style table, chair seating and bar seating.  The pizza special for the day today was an 11\\\" white pizza with asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli, ricotta, mozzarella and red pepper flakes.  I ordered the special without mushrooms with a Coke to drink (yay Coke products!) and it was just over $12.  \\n\\nI love, love, love white pizza.  This, I did not love.  I do not like for the ricotta to be in globs on the pizza, which this was.  It's a personal preference, and not a reflection of a bad tasting pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy without being hard.  The broccoli was cooked through as was the asparagus.  The red pepper flakes were a little heavy in some places on the pizza, but overall it was well balanced.  \\n\\nThe wait staff delivers your food and checks a few times to see if you need refills and see if everything is okay.  I found them all to be pleasant and helpful.  A couple of gentlemen, that I believe to be the owners and/or the chef(s) after seeing their webpage, were walking around the restaurant checking on people as well.  I did like that the restaurant seemed to be kid/family friendly without catering specifically to children, thus alienating those of us who don't want to listen to some guy making balloon animals while trying to eat.  \\n\\nThe execution of the pizza was fine, I just didn't particularly care for this pizza.

The whole place does indeed look like a library - not one where you borrow books, but more like a library/study in somebody's old house.  I went with four friends on a Monday night, and we easily got a table outside on their upstairs patio.  It was great to sit outside on a summer evening.  You don't get a great view from up there - it has high walls so you can't even see much of the sky - but it's still a way to get some air and escape the noise of the street.\\n\\nThe menus are taped inside the first few pages of giant coffee table books, so all of our menus had a different theme!  One of my friends actually got quite involved reading his book and didn't want the server to take it away.  It's really a nice, clever touch.  We arrived early enough to catch the end of happy hour for $3 draft beers - they had a nice, creative selection.  \\n\\nWe started with the Billy Goats Gruff - poblano peppers stuffed with goat cheese and chipotle cream sauce.  And wow, were they spicy!  We really enjoyed the creaminess, but they do have a kick so watch out!  We also got The Tale of Ginger and Pickles - fried pickles, essentially, which were okay but a bit sour for my taste.  I got some pizza, and it was a great price for way more pizza than I could eat.

I looked at the studios website URBANYOGAPHX.COM before going over for a class. It has detailed descriptions of all of the classes and teachers.It tells you all about the studio and what it has to offer. As soon as I walked in to Urban Yoga, I felt comfortable. I was greeted by a friendly girl at the front desk. She was very engaging and showed me around the studio before the start of class. The over all vibe at the studio just feels comfortable.  Its esthetically pleasing and kept clean. The class was excellent. Lindsey was the teacher and she had a great energy and knowledge of yoga. I like that the class is one hour. It is just the right amount of time. I also had a class with Megan and it was very challenging. I loved it. I enjoy the variety of teachers and styles that Urban Yoga offers.

{"id": 10216, "label": 4, "text": "I came to the Wynn for the first time a couple years back, just after they opened. Haven't stayed anywhere else since (and I go to Vegas every couple of months).\\n\\nGambling:\\nOthers have commented on the high minimum tables, and they're right -- the $25 minimums mostly turn into $50 by 9 or 10pm on a weekend, and are kind of like citronella for the hordes that swarm around cheap tables in otherwise nice hotels like the Venetian. On top of the thinner crowds, the dealers here are the best on the strip. I've gotten to know a few and highly recommend Joy at the $50 blackjack tables (usually on the noon-8 shift). She's a bundle of, well, joy, and energy and is always a delight to play with. She'll get the table talking and joking, and really makes it a nice experience regardless of whether you're winning or losing.\\n\\nI've been playing more poker lately, and the poker room at the Wynn, while small, is comfortable and full of action. Not off the hook Commerce Casino action, but the $500 no limit frequently sees $1000 pots and there are always good players as well as rich tourists abounding. I'm an okay player, and I've discovered that the game for me is about whether I can gobble up the rich tourist dollars faster than the pros can take me down. I've had a couple of great nights as well as one god awful weekend here, but it's always been fun! \\n\\nRooms:\\nThe rooms are superb. I don't think the walls are any thinner than other high end hotels on the strip and have never overheard conversations, etc. I read a review talking about the noise from the club and am astonished -- I've stayed on low floors, high floors, and suites, and have NEVER noticed club noise or strip noise. It's a hotel, not a sanatorium, so there's some audible presence of others, but if that keeps you awake at night you've got issues. I've stayed during working trips also, and found the rooms to be really conducive to work: fast internet, speedy room service, and space to lay out books and papers while you work.\\n\\nFood:\\nMy favorite restaurant in Vegas is the Daniel Boulud brasserie at the Wynn. It's pricey, but the value you get makes it feel like a steal! Don't miss the charcuterie appetizer, and I highly recommend the steak dinner. The sommeliers are superb and have never tried to upsell me past my price-point -- in fact, I was once going to splurge and told him I was interested in a great wine and would spend $300-$400; he came back with a $250 recommendation! \\n\\nThe other restaurants are all pretty stellar. Bartolotta is fantastic -- they fly in their fish from the Mediterranean daily and when you order a whole fish it's filleted for you tableside which is such fun to watch. Corsa is solid Italian food (they once made an off-menu pesto preparation for me, which is odd at high-traffic restaurants but spoke volumes about their customer service). The country club has what is possibly the best lobster preparation in the country (steamed and served with drawn tarragon butter that makes me drool to think about). Okada is a little oasis of sushi with fanciful preparations and the softest toro I've had since Hamano Sushi in San Francisco. SW has never once overcooked my steak and gets the exact temperature and color on a 3-inch thick filet which is not easy. My only hold out is Wing Lei. Maybe I've just never had the right thing, but most of the food there tastes like regular Chinese food, except much more expensive. \\n\\nCustomer Service\\nI benefit from having a Casino Host (Pucci -- World's Best Host!) who arranges my stays. But the fact that I have a host at all once again speaks volumes about Customer Service at the Wynn, since I'm nowhere near a high roller. Sure, I'll play the $100 black jack tables, but as others have pointed out that's nothing at this place. On a weekend night, there are banks of tables that I can't even go near. Yet I've never once paid for a room and Pucci frequently finds a way to cover a good chunk of my (at time exorbitant) restaurant tabs."}

Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also, most of the appliances have been updated to stainless steel.  In addition to the tiles in the kitchen and bathroom, most condos have either carpet or have been upgraded to wood flooring.  In all honesty when I was first looking at these condos they are similar to the neighboring complex, Red Rox.  However, Riverwalk has larger balconies and their exterior is painted a nice neutral white and tan, compared to Red Rox, which is a red and green color and always reminds me of christmas.      \\n\\nIn addition to the condos, I feel the location of these condos is fabulous! Located right on the border of Tempe and Phoenix; and Scottsdale is less than 5 minutes away.  Papago Park is right across the street for nice scenery, hiking and biking.  The Oakland A's baseball stadium is in walking distance for Spring Training games.  Also, the Phoenix Zoo is about a block away, next to the Botanical Gardens.  Right down the road is the Marquee Theater, the light rail, and Mill Ave.  Very easy to get anywhere you want to go from these condos!"}

It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!\\n\\n\\nOne of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.\\n\\nHere is how the food stacked up..................\\n\\nPork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!\\n\\nBaby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!\\n\\nSmoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!\\n\\nLean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.\\n\\nLoaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!\\n\\nHalf Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.\\n\\nCreamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.\\n\\nCoke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.\\n\\nService was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.  \\n\\nThis was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!"}

I counted 7 screens but I forgot to see if there were any over by the pool tables.  4 pool tables, 7 dart boards, shuffleboard and a couple of video games.  The tables and stools are all anchored.  The door has been replaced with a privacy wall in the men's room and the one stall looks like the door has been removed and replaced a few times.  The padded rails on the tables need reupholstering.  Overall the place seems in pretty good shape.  They have a fenced in smoking patio but I didn't see any chairs or tables on it.\\n\\nI had a toasted ham and cheese on sourdough ($5.75)and I chose to have it with onion rings, although I could have chosen fries or cottage cheese.  It was good and I thought a pretty good deal.  I had MGD long necks at $3 each.  Not sure if that was happy hour or regular price, I didn't ask.  \\n\\nAll the employees I dealt with were pleasant and efficient.  I Left by 7 so I don't know if the vibe changes as the evening goes on.  I noticed several folks just like me that joined friends and left after a drink or two.  I had a good time with friends and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.\\n\\nThe woman opening up early Saturday sure looked at me funny taking pictures of the place as she walked up to the door. :-)"}

I got told I could have cake, then the cake was a lie, then there was cake again. Quit playing with my heart! I would've ordered some food to go with the cake if you hadn't taken almost an hour to bring it out of the freezer. My love of dessert for dinner is unrivaled, but this was really crappy cake that I ended up giving away because I couldn't stomach it's frozen sickly sweetness.

Excellent location and beautifully modeled. \\n\\nThis place seems to be very busy, which is excellent for them. When you walk in, it's an order and seat yourself type of joint. #1 reason why I will tell you this place is overpriced. \\nAlso overpriced because it's off the strip. You would expect these kind of prices on there, but not for the regulars in town that's far enough from the strip. \\nAnother thing I'm not much of a fan of, they have shared seating here. Which is okay for some places, but a place like this? Probably not. It's so small in here as it is. People tend to take odd chairs and leave room for 1 person when if they could have scooted down just one, it'd make so much more room for parties over 2 people. It's too hard to leave easy things up to people because they'll fuck it up every time. \\n\\nThe food here is good. I will say that and that is was pretty quick. \\nOverall, just for a lunch with 2 drinks costed us $41.00 plus tip. That's a little much in my opinion. For the location, the food and the fact that you serve yourself, seat yourself and they have a tip on the receipt is just asking a lot of people. \\n\\n\\nWe had - \\nThe Hangover Burger\\nGrilled Cheese\\nClam Chowder\\n\\nClam Chowder: Delicious. Some of the best we've had in town. Full of clams, good sauce that's not so creamy that you have to force it down.\\nGrilled Cheese: I was not a fan at all. I probably should have read the description better because I couldn't even eat it. It was just such a bizarre combination of flavors and I do not ever NOT finish my dish. The cheese is not melted, it's half walnuts and the bread is toasted with honey. It was so sweet and odd. \\nThe Hangover Burger: Delicious. The flavors were all meshed in an tasted excellent. The bacon was nice and crispy and the flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was very messy, but very well worth it. Oh, and those fries...FREAKING amazing!\\n\\nThe customer service was fine, I just don't know if I'm okay paying a tip when it's not sit down service. But, some people don't agree with this. \\n\\nOverall, it's a nice location, modernly decorated, nice people, good food and excellent for a quick hot meal.

Actually, we heard about this place from our daughter's Spanish teacher, whom is also from Colombia, but a different area.  My husband has been missing food from his country, though, periodically we will make some dishes.\\n\\nWe ordered several things - for drinks we ordered Lulo, Passion Fruit, and Manzana Postobon.  The Manzana Postobon is like a fizzy apple drink.  The Lulo is a fruit drink but had some sort of creaminess to it.  This was my favorite of hte three.  The Passion Fruit kind of had a sweet, slightly tart taste - very strong taste.  Each of these drinks were $2.50, well the Mazana was $1.75.\\n\\nI asked for water and they gave us bottled water.  I'm not sure if they have just regular water that is not bottled.  We got 2 bottles and this cost $1.  I did not see any regular fountain drinks, so things are either by bottle or can.\\n\\nWe ordered two different arepas - one was a cheese and the other was a shredded beef.  Arepa Con Queso and Arepa Con Carne.  The Arepa Con Queso came after we finished eating and we were stuffed, so we could not eat this.  The Arepa Con Carne ($3.99)  wasn't quite as tasty as the Cheese Arepa ($2.99).  \\n\\nThe Arepa for the Shredded Beef was dry and a little crisp like, so hard to cut with the knife, so it was easier to tear this.  The beef tasted a bit dry, but my husband said that's the way it's supposed to be.  I found I had to add a little salt to it.  \\n\\nSo, if I had to choose in the future, the Cheese Arepa is what I like because it had a little moisture to it.  The cheese comes from Mexico and not Colombia.  It tasted fine, but I think I still prefer the Colombian cheese.\\n\\nWe ordered 2 dishes and split between my husband, son and I:  the Bandeja Paisa and Mojarra Frita (each plate was $12.95).  Both plates had a lot of food and each plate did come with rice.  The Mojarra Frita is basically fried Tilapia.  This was a bit messy to eat, but was tasty.  It came with some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes, slices of lemon on top of the fish, white rice, and 2 small patacones (fried plantains).  \\n\\nThe Bandeja Paisa had a bunch of things - Colombian Chorizo, Frijoles (beans), a slice of avocado, some baked plantain slices (sweet), a fried egg, some ground beef stuff, a mini arepa, white rice, and some pork rind with meat.  All of it was very tasty, but the Colombian Chorizo was the tastiest.\\n\\nThe white rice isn't like how the Chinese make it, which is plain, rather there is salt and some oil added to the rice, which makes it tasty that you could eat by itself.  I think I could have just eaten some chorizo and the white rice or chorizo with the cheese arepa.\\n\\nFor all this food - 2 arepas, 3 drinks, and 2 plates, it came to about $44.  A little pricey for lunch, but well worth it.  \\n\\nMy husband said the food tasted like he remembered and it made him happy.  We'll come back again.\\n\\nToo bad there is so much construction with the Light Rail near there, but we noticed there were other Colombians that were dining there.  So, it's good to find a good Colombian food place there.\\n\\nAlso, my husband found some bocadillo in their little store.  He likes this much better than the guava paste thing at the Mexican store.  I'm still missing the Colombian cheese, which they didn't have at this store.\\n\\nI believe at least the front people were all from Colombian, our waitress was from Cali.\\n\\nThe service was really good and fast.  No complaints here.  They had a steady stream of customers this mid Saturday afternoon."}

But that's fine! We expect to be charged for delivery, and we had a Christmas gift card, so no big deal.\\n\\nThis is important: When we completed our order online (over $400 worth), no where did it say we would be charged any more. $300+ for our items and $80 for delivery, and that was it.\\n\\n40 minutes later, we get a call for scheduling.

Delivery fee of $80 but crappy pallets are an extra $15 a pallet? Wtf is that delivery fee for then? A 20 year old rando dropping off stuff on our driveway???\\n2. I have to bring you back your stupid pallets... when I ordered online for delivery. Hmm, what does that tell you? That I DON'T want to waste time going to Lowe's.\\n\\nWhat are we supposed to do, hang around customer service with our 3-4 pallets?

That's why I ordered for delivery in the first place...\\n\\nWhen we disputed this charge (which, to remind you, wasn't mentioned AT ALL in the fine print, so... bait and switch tactic), the manager was rude and ended up hanging up on us.\\n\\nClassy, manager! Please, hang up on customers who have already spent over $5,000 at Lowe's and who had planned to spend a lot more. Btw - this isn't about a $45 fee.

One thing we really liked was the food was not greasy, just fresh and delicious! It is also much more affordable- and they deliver."}

If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.\\n\\nMy husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving. \\n\\nWe both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!\\n\\nFor a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!"}

{"id": 10741, "label": 0, "text": "Art's was recommended by a family friend; however, after my experience there I am really wondering how often they actually used Art's. The guys working the front desk are super nice, but unfortunately the actual work there was absolutely no good.  The only thing they got right was a basic oil change. I have a 2004 Toyota SUV and I took it into Art's for the first time for some work and they replaced the shocks, did the oil change, and supposedly did some work on the brakes.  They charged us just over $1,000 for the work which was reasonable. I have no problem with that. A couple days after getting the car back it started making a really obnoxious squeaking and creaking noise when I braked, turned, went over bumps, or even got out of the car! We called Art's and took the car back.  The mechanic got into the car to listen to the noise while I drove and commented that he is \\\"not used to working on cars like this\\\". I'm not sure what he meant, a Toyota is pretty common and basic! We left it there and it was quiet for about a day after picking it up later.  It started squeaking again, this time it was worse though.  We decided to pay and take it to Toyota AutoNation and they figured out the problem right away.  Art's had given us a defective shock that wasn't supposed to go in my type of car. I'm baffled on how they didn't realize this the second time around at Art's.  We took it back for the third time, told them what AutoNation said and showed them the paperwork, and they replaced the shock.  However, a couple days later the car was worse than ever and I was almost scared to drive it.  We gave up on Art's and went back to AutoNation.  The shock Art's used was STILL the wrong type of shock, and they told us my wheels could have come off while driving.  They also checked the brakes and apparently there was about a millimeter left on the back where Art's had supposedly fixed them.  My car is now just fine thanks to AutoNation's common sense.  I am very disappointed with Art's: It complete wast of time and money on incompetent mechanics and useless car parts."}

{"id": 46396, "label": 1, "text": "My friend sent me the Yelp page for Hek Yeah and what do you know?  4.5 stars based on 51 reviews!  Damn impressive....or so it would seem.  Well, since I can't, for the life of me, find reasonable BBQ here in Phoenix off to Hek Yeah I go.  Fingers crossed.\\n\\nI showed up at opening on a Saturday and was the first customer of the day.  I thought for a second that the restaurant was still closed because the lights were off and the chairs were still on the tables.  However, the neon \\\"Open\\\" sign was lit and the owner was there welcoming me in.  It looked like he arrived just minutes before me.  After turning on the lights, firing up the point-of-sale system and taking down the chairs, the owner talked me through a few items on the menu.  I ordered the 2 meat with ribs and 2 sides platter which rang up to about $21 with a drink.  I picked beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats.  Mac 'n' cheese and baked beans got the call for my sides.  I took a seat and waited for my order which did not take too long to come out.\\n\\nAPPEARANCE\\nThe food came out on a sizzling metal platter.  Portion sizes were very generous and it also came with a bread roll.  The pork was pulled or shredded as expected, but so was the beef brisket which caught me a little off guard.  I guess I was expecting it to come out sliced which is always my preference.  Why?  Because when it is sliced it tells me two things:  1.  It was cooked properly. When brisket gets overcooked it becomes difficult to slice and you end up having to pull, chop, or shred it.; and 2.  It is a good quality piece of beef.  When you pull, chop or shred beef you can usually get away with using cheaper meat.  Often times, the shredded meat is tossed with fat drippings or sauce which compensates for poorer quality meat.  However, for the sake of this review, let's give the benefit of the doubt and chalk this presentation up to preference.  Many people choose to shred their brisket because that's how they like to do it for sandwiches or perhaps it was a \\\"slice the flat, chop the point\\\" type decision.  Food was hot and all appeared fine.\\n\\nTASTE & TENDERNESS\\nTo start, I went straight for the ribs.  Well, actually what I got was more the \\\"flap\\\" than actual ribs.  Either way, I pick them up by the bone and the meat literally fell off the bone.  Despite what Outback Steakhouse or Chili's commercials will lead you to believe, fall off the bone ribs are NOT GOOD.  This means that the meat was OVERCOOKED and the way this meat just fell apart leads me to believe that it was not cooked that day.  Tasting the meat confirmed this suspicion as it was practically disintegrating in my mouth and it also felt and looked like it was heated up in the microwave.  The pulled pork and beef brisket were equally flavorless and dry.  The bread was \\\"crusty\\\" on the outside, but not very warm on the inside.  On a positive note, I really liked the baked beans and the mac 'n' cheese.  They were cooked properly, seasoned well and tasted good.\\n\\nTo sum it up, I was very disappointed with the food.  I just paid $21 for overcooked, underseasoned, dry flavorless food.  On top of that, due to the taste and texture of the food, I highly suspect that the food was not fresh (read \\\"made the day BEFORE\\\").  Again, this is just my suspicion, but I look at it like this.....if the food was made fresh (i.e., that morning), but still tasted like it was made the day before and reheated then there are some other problems going on here that need to be addressed.  So, sorry Yelpers.  The hyperbole on Hek Yeah BBQ stops here.  If somebody asks me to join them for BBQ at this place my response will be, \\\"HEK NO!\\\""}

I ordered some kind of scramble with mushrooms and sausage in it, with a side of thick-cut bacon. I also tried to order hot chocolate, but only some coffee was available. They didn't even offer tea. I got the coffee anyways... it was decidedly gross. (It's not that I don't drink coffee, just wasn't in the mood, but I was freezing.)\\n\\nThe breakfast portion was huge, but I really didn't eat most of it. Everything was cold, which was a bit confusing because it came out so fast. The scramble was watery. The toast was not toast at all... just bread. Not warm, not crisp. The potatoes were pretty dry. Bacon was reasonably delish, though.\\n\\nStill, I guess for a \\\"sit-down\\\" breakfast in the Charlotte Airport without having to go out of my way, I'm fairly grateful for Bad Daddy's existence.

Someone called back saying they were with Arizona Pest Squad and missed a call from my number. I asked if he listed to my message, he said no. So I had to explain myself all over again. At the end he said he would be at my house around 430. I thought to myself, same day service?! How awesome. 430 comes, 530 comes, 630 comes and they call saying that they got caught on a job with bees. Understandable, but a call before you were gonna be late would have been awesome so I didn't sit around waiting for you. Person said he could come out right then or about the same time the next day. I said right then worked, he then asked if the next day would be ok.... sooooo why did you give me a choice if you weren't going to go with the one I picked? Anyways he offered 50% off to do it the next day around 430, and I'll never say no to cheap stuff. \\n\\nSame thing next day, except this time he called about 530. I didn't even answer because I couldn't believe I fell for it a second time. He left a message saying he didn't want to come out because it was raining, but would if I wanted him to. I didn't call back. I go out in the living room and see something in my door frame, a note saying sorry we missed you, it's raining, will call to make another appt. Never knocked or rang the doorbell. I have two large dogs, who have something against doorbells and anyone who touches the door, so I know for a fact there was no effort to get my attention while at the house. \\n\\nSo I write the managers an e-mail explaining my whole story. Apparently the guy I had been talking to was a owner. He kept referring the the \\\"yelp review\\\" I wrote, when I had just e-mailed him and never said a word about it on yelp, yet. He offered to service my property for free. I couldn't say no to free stuff, so we set it up a fourth time.... when am I gonna learn, right? \\n\\nI waited until the time we discussed, and at the exact minute he was late, I left to go workout. I was done with this company. He doesn't call me till an hour later saying he's at my house, and to call back and reschedule... AGAIN. No thanks, you couldn't pay me to waste anymore of my time waiting for a company that couldn't show up to save their lives. Run fellow yelpers, run. \\n\\nIt is one thing to be late and let someone know, it is another to be late four times, and not call till at least an hour later every time. I do appreciate him offering to take half off, and to fully cover the bill the next time it happened. But you can't keep screwing up and being late."}

First, they claim same day reservations as they are the largest spa in the country or the world. When I walked up for a service to be schedule later in the day between 12 and 4 I was told that most of the massage types I was requisition were not available and then I found one and then he said it was booked while we were talking. So, I ended up with just a general massage which was fine and he did give me 20% off for my troubles. Now, that is not really a big deal as this is an easy discount to get but I appreciated the effort. I think this was more of a staffing issue than anything else with the availability. \\n\\nWhen I got there ahead of time it took them quite a while to get me back so I had almost zero time to spend in the steam room and sauna. What I noticed that was different this time was that the massage rooms seemed to be almost like a cheap row of motel rooms. The massage was nothing stellar, just run of the mill. This is where the biggest disappointment would occur.\\n\\nI left my key ten miles back in the room. Now, I do not think there is any way you could remember which room you had been in. If there was, I never saw it. I asked the locker room attendant if he could help. He looked for my intake form and could not find it. Then, he just pawns it off on another employee who was very irritated to be bothered. Finally, when he found the slip which has been misfiled because the guy wrote hi T like an L or something he walked over to my locker and opened it and then just walked off. Now, this gave me no opportunity to shower or anything without leaving my locker open. Very poor service and frankly unacceptable. I will not likely return when in Vegas. \\n\\nI did want to bring this to a manager's attention on my way out but they had one person working the desk and a line of three folks and i had a dinner reservation to get to and now have to get to my room to shower."}

Enclosed was a check and short note: 'It's your birthday. Don't behave.'\\n\\nI'll do my best, Maw and Paw.\\n\\nI worked late that cloudy Monday of March, and after work I stopped to get my Crown Vic's oil changed. Then I went to the bank, then to the car wash, and then proceeded to drive around in a funk. Didn't want to go home, didn't know where to go. Wasn't up for The Strip, wasn't up for one of my regular watering holes. I hadn't told anyone it was my birthday so I was free from required appearances.\\n\\nSo I drove down 215, windows open, music off. I saw Green Valley Ranch Hotel/Casino in the distance. It had been a few years since my last visit so I decided to stop in.\\n\\nAfter parking on the top floor I strode through the massive doors. The casino floor was pretty empty. Typical for a Monday at an off-strip casino. I plucked a twenty from my pocket and stuck it in a Wheel of Fortune machine. No lie: I sat there for over an hour on the same twenty. Made it up to 95 bucks before watching it whittle down to nothing. No matter. I might be a lot of things but hard up for cash was never one of them.\\n\\nIt was around 6 PM and I was hungry. I kept thinking of my parents' request not to behave so I decided to drop some major deniro at Hank's. I walked in, found a seat at the bar, and stared at some NCAA basketball. \\n\\nA word about Hank's: It's expensive, tastefully decorated, sanguine. Here's a look: http://greenvalleyranch.sclv.com/dining/hanks/?utm_source=YELP&utm_medium=SOCIAL&utm_term=GVR&utm_content=GVR-PROPERTIES&utm_campaign=GVR-YELP\\nNot a lot of seating, great wine selection, pretty servers. As for the latter, mine was a tall drink of brunette. Wondrous curves with tresses to match. What a masterpiece. I asked for a glass of Red Rock and looked through the menu. All sorts of interesting and pricey selections. \\n\\nThe decision: crab cakes to start, dry aged bone-in NY--medium, mac and cheese. I gave Tall Drink my order and she moved like a swan to fill it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I sipped my drink, watched the games, and smiled at Tall Drink.\\n\\nEnter crab cakes.\\n\\nKind of on the small side, one with a small garden atop, some yellow sauce beneath. I wish they had been larger with more sauce but they were good. Not too dry, not too moist. \\n\\nEnter steak and mac/cheese. \\n\\nBoth were too salty in my opinion.\\n\\nThe meat was correctly cooked and had good flavor. But too much salt.\\n\\nThe mac and cheese had a fantastic cheese taste but too much salt.\\n\\nI guess people must like their food salty but I'm not one of them. Nevertheless, I did like dipping my meat in the cheese sauce every third or fourth forkful. Such an act would likely cause gourmets to pass out but I don't care. And despite the sodium content I did manage to temper its power with some good old black pepper.\\n\\nI ate every crumb and asked for a dessert menu. Easy choice. Bugs Bunny Special, aka carrot cake. What's up, Doc?! And wow was that a big slab of decadent goodness! Fine cream cheese with a nice dollop of whipped cream on the side. Fantastic!\\n\\nI finished my beer and asked Tall Drink for the bill. It was around 100 bucks and with tip even more. But I was told not to behave, remember?\\n\\nAnyway, I paid and rose to leave, but not without smiling at TD a final time. I'm sure she awaits my return with patient desire.\\n\\nAnd I shall return one day. Perhaps with an even greater desire to misbehave...."}

When I had called, they had asked if we were there for a special occasion and I had mentioned that we were there for a birthday.However, once we got there, they made no mention of it. It wouldn't have been a big deal but everyone else on yelp had their birthday person recognized.   Why ask and then not follow through? Not cool. Not cool at all. \\n\\nService is outstanding! We started off with the amuse bouche, which consisted of a cauliflower mousse. Absolutely delicious. The servers kept coming back and forth to make sure we had enough bread and water. Kept cleaning our table over and over. They had this little bread crumb lifter that removed all the crumbs. That's high class! Their waitstaff is awesome and for that alone I would say go. \\n\\nMy mom got the recommended parmesean crusted  chicken while I got the lamb burger. She liked the chicken but it was a little to heavy for me. I got the lamb burger, but it was a little too strong for me, so I'd have to pass. We both ordered a non-alcoholic lime drink which was tasty and a great alternative to the alky. \\nWe ended up getting our own dessert, the strawberry souffle with pistachios. Kind of reminded us of strawberry ice cream since they freeze it, but a nice option to the end of the meal. \\n\\nWould I go again? I don't know. I usually go to Vegas for celebrations, either birthdays or graduations and such, so we usually go all out.

I knew going in it might be a gimmick to get people interested in the place and it worked on me. \\n\\nWe were seated by the bar at a high top table. It was a few min before our waiter came out and brought waters without me having to ask. This was very nice. He also later brought out a glass bottle of water for the table. Loved this!!! I ordered my smoked bourbon. There is a nice long list of options. I chose a blackberry house bourbon with cherry wood and made sure to ask for them to make it on my side of the bar. It is definitely a fun drink to watch being made. It was finished with a large ice cube and an orange peel. This might have been my favorite drink EVER. Even more then my beloved Samos Nectar. \\n\\nFor my entree I chose the Worker Burgher. It was delish. The goat cheese with the caramelized onion was perfect. The fries were just ok. They didn't have much of a crunch and were over salted. I can say they were definitely fresh though. \\n\\nI must give a shout out to our server who was excellent. I've been disappointed with service lately and he restored my faith.  Also I could see the kitchen window and they have a designated expediter.

It was a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions, that was accompanied by feta cheese and dressed with a vinaigrette. It was very delicious, if you like the tomatoes. If you don't, I would skip it. \\n\\nThe Milo Special:  At least this is what I think it is called. It was zucchini and eggplant that was lightly fried and had a yogurt dipping with it. That was the highlight of the night. \\n\\n(Meh: The Calamari and The Wine)\\n\\nThe Calamari: It was a little chewy. I didn't really care for it. \\n\\nThe Wine: It was sweet, but I could stomach it. \\n\\n(Cons: The Service/Staff and The Fish, The Atmosphere, and The Steak Fries)\\n\\nLet's Start with the food: The Fish was okay. It was basically red snapper with capers, lemon, and olive oil. It was okay, but I had better. It would be in the meh section, but it was 200 dollars. For 200 dollar fish, it better knock my socks off. Also,  it had bones in it. \\nThe steak fries were awful. There was no seasoning or anything there and they were soggy. \\n\\nThe atmosphere: It was was so loud in this place. I couldn't hear anything. We had a large party and couldn't hear half of the conversation. It was very loud. \\n\\nThe service and staff: They were slow. We arrived at 7:30 didn't leave until 11 or so. Plus, when I asked them to explain a few items on the menu they couldn't adequately explain things to me. (that is if you can hear anything in this place) They are also business people. They like to deceive you here.  \\nWe asked for water, they bring us bottled water that they charge 8 dollars a pop for. We asked for fish, they tell us that it can't feed a group of our size, and adds lamb, which is another 200 dollars. (I didn't eat the lamb that is why is it not on here). Its not the prices that were the problem, it was the fact that they deceived us and ranked up the bill. We had eight people and they added 18 percent gratitude on the bill which is probably why he was making a lot of the suggestions.  I rather you be upfront with me about the prices and let me make the choice if I wanted to eat there or not. This is the type of thing that is admired there, and it is a shame. I will not be dining there anymore. But needless to say, we were blindsided by the bill and took about 30 minutes to figure out, which they complained about. It was ridiculous. Never again will I eat there for some mediocre fish.  I had better fish for a 1/20 of that price. Real disappointment."}

The other problem with hash house was the portions, they give you way too much on one trough sized plate, it's intimidating to see when it comes out, it makes you feel that every meal was an eating competition of it's own, no wonder man vs. food went there.

Just a few blocks from the Mont-Royal metro station, it is actually a tiny place wedged in a residential neighborhood.  There weren't more than 10 tables, and the atmosphere was very homey and intimate.  We decided to all do the 5-course option, which ranged from 48-55 bucks depending on which main course you ordered.   \\n\\nThe meal started with a cream of vegetable soup.  Simple and boring you might think, but it was very yummy and made us all excited for what was to come.  \\n\\nI then had the escargots as my appetizer, and it was absolutely heavenly.  I am a big fan of escargots, and this dish reminded me why.  The blue cheese sauce it was in was subtle but delicious, and I sopped up every last drop with my bread.  \\n\\nNext came a palate cleanser of sorts - a scoop of green apple sorbet dropped in some brandy.  Everyone in our group LOVED this - especially as the sorbet melted in the brandy.  I had never had anything like this during a meal, so it was a really pleasant surprise.  \\n\\nFor my main dish, I had the roasted quail, which I found to be well-seasoned in a nice wine sauce.  All the main entrees came with the same sides - a mix of seasonal vegetables.

Although not the highlight of the meal, it was a nice and light way to end the night.\\n\\nThe service was great here, even though there seemed to be only one waiter running the place.\\n\\nAnother great thing about this place?

I'm big on music and dj was on fire all the latest music. Mostly hip hop which I love cause let face it who wants to watch strippers dance to Taylor swift or sum bs.

I walked in to a lively and raucous discussion among the 6-7 salesmen about a customer who'd just left.  She was, from what I gathered, a very attractive blonde woman, and drove a convertible BMW.  The employees were enthusiastically speculating about how much ejaculate she must have swallowed, and how many times she must have performed fellatio to afford such a car.  Despite the 20 years I spent as a construction worker, even I was appalled at some of the comments made.  What was even more disturbing was that the staff didn't seem to care that customers could, and did, hear their comments.  I spent about 8-10 minutes in the store, just enough time to do a quick scan of inventory and prices, and the conversation continued the entire time.  Plus, it wasn't until I was on my way out of the store that one of the employees asked if there was anything they could help me with.   Considering their brazenness, I have to assume that they talk about any and all females that enter their store in similarly derogatory terms.  Don't take your wives, daughters, girlfriends or any other female to this establishment.  Their prices and inventory are otherwise very reasonable, and under other circumstances, I probably would have purchased from them."}

I used Joey for my enagament photos around the strip (7/3/13) and for wedding (10/17/13). I decided I wanted a non traditional intimate wedding but wanted something special with family and close friends. When I decided on a Vegas wedding... I thought I probably wouldnt be able to get an amazing photographer.  I know in other area like the bay area (where Im from) and southern California (where I currently live) the average rate for wedding photographers is around $3000+ that would have been around 30% of my wedding budget! Having amazing photos of my wedding was one of the most important vendor decisions (above floral, makeup, even venue etc). I love photography and these photos are how I will forever remember my wedding. I was delighted to find Joeys website. He had an extensive portfolio and he even posted his AFFORDABLE rates on his website.  He answered all my emails promtly. My photos are gorgeous!  I get so many compliments on them. He almost made the ceremony look even more beautiful then it was... how does someone do that? My mother-in-law commented about the ceremony photos \\\"this is how Heaven must look like\\\"...which is funny because I thought the same thing. He really went above and beyond. During my engagment shoot, he met us on a holiday weekend on the strip at 9pm and worked with us until after midnight to get thousands of shots (he charged a low flat rate for this). It was 110\\u00b0 at night and the streets were packed! At my wedding he worked tirelessly throughout the 8 hours we hired him for... he wouldnt he even take a break when I asked him to have something to eat. My guests even remarked on how hard he was working.  Thank you Joey for giving us amazing wedding photos that we will treasure for the rest of our life!"}

{"id": 3251, "label": 3, "text": "I think I might have spent a little too long deciding what to include in this post, but as someone who has spent a long time renting and had some pretty miserable experiences, I try to include everything I wish I would have known. Apartment reviews can be TERRIFYING, there are some angry renters out there. Here's what I took from my lovely 10 month stay at Miramonte. \\n1. This apartment doesn't look like much from the outside, and its nothing fancy for sure, but in my experience the office staff is extremely helpful, the maintenance man is reliable and friendly (eventually I even had no problem giving him permission to enter while I wasn't there) and its very reasonably priced. The interiors are updated with nicer carpet, newer kitchens and they have washer and dryers! big plus for me.\\n\\n2. The pool is awesome, when it works. They have been having some issues but I do believe its fixed now. The gym is tiny but usually empty. \\n\\n3. its pretty quiet, most of the time. I lived upstairs and was never bothered by my neighbors noise. But I do believe my downstairs neighbor was slightly annoyed by me (and I am not loud and hardly home.) So Point A--live upstairs. I've found that to be true in EVERY apt complex ive ever lived in. Point B--PLEASE NOTE--THIS IS IMPORTANT--there is an elementary school on the east side of the apartment complex. I lived directly up from the parking lot, facing the school playground, and you could absolutely hear little kids playing in the morning.  It didn't ever bother me because I work all week, I only discovered this when I happened to be home sick one Wednesday. If you work a Monday-Fri 9-5 you really wont notice so I would not let that deter you from moving in. However if you sleep in late during the week, choose your location carefully, don't get a unit that faces the school.\\n\\n 4. The office staff will really try to be accommodating. A new office manager took over a couple months after I moved in and you can really tell she wants people to be happy about the complex. I lived here while in the process of buying a house and definitely did my share of calling the office staff with questions about extending my lease, ending my lease, month to month options, etc. When my house closed 2 months before my lease ended, of course I couldn't get out of my legally binding contract (no surprise to me there) but I was surprised that they were very helpful about my options to sublease it myself or find someone to take over my lease completely. They definitely did as much as they could. \\n\\n5. Parking for visitors isnt the worst I've seen but it can be difficult. There are always tons of spots open on the south end of the complex, but in the evenings most of the other public ones are taken. \\n\\n6. Bugs- always a big concern of mine and I would have no shame in admitting if I found them. (see my other apt review, ha!). Honestly, I found one big cockroach about a month after I moved in, called the office, they had the sprayer come and I never saw another one again. (I lived there for 10 months)\\n\\n7. charges. They WILL charge you for damages done to your walls or carpets, for anything that is not top-notch clean, or anything that isnt as it was when you moved in. But they aren't trying to scam you. Use your common sense on this one, you get a form to fill out when you move in that lists every detail of every room, FILL IT OUT. Keep a copy. Be present when they do the final walk through and you will be aware of any discrepancies. Just be a responsible renter and you will only pay the standard $35 carpet cleaning fee. \\n\\nHope that was helpful to anyone considering an apartment here. Granted all experiences and units are different, so if you move in and hate it, whoops. If you move in and like it, as I did, you're welcome."}

It was around the same time that X-Files came out, the first two seasons when it was aired on Friday nights at midnight and no one knew about it and it was considered a cult favorite. Long before it became a mainstream cultural phenomena.\\nAt that time, Cafe Cine Express would host X-files viewings, so that people could come in and watch the latest episode at Friday midnight viewings. It was awesome,  a total geekfest. Everyone silently eating really good cakes or pastries or drinking fresh coffee while watching episodes on alien abductions, conspiracy theories and cryptozoology on the giant screen in the back. Those were the days.\\n\\nSince those days, from what I understand the ownership has changed hands a few times, and it seems to get worse each time.

If you're lucky, you can get in and out of the yogurt shop within 5-10min however, if there is just ONE more person than you, you might end up waiting for 20+min. When I went, there was only one lady in front of me and she ordered two smoothies. The worker took her order and immediately went to make her drinks without  even acknowleding me.. not even a \\\"I'll be right with you\\\". In addition, I also thought that you should take orders in batches and since I was right after her, I just assumed he could take my order also before going on to make it (just in case we had the same order so he could save time and make it double). \\nHowever, what really irritated me is that this guy took 15+min to make TWO smoothies. I know he really wanted to make the drinks as smooth as possible but c'mon! I'm not exactly sure how long it took him because I left after 15min. I might have waited if he acknowledged me but he didn't.... The wait must really suck if someone ordered a crepe.. sheesh!"}

The facilities are news, super-clean, and very calming. There are 2 spacious studios - 1 on the main level, 1 upstairs. The reception area includes a small smoothie and snack bar where they serve complimentary tea. There is also a small boutique with yoga wear, mats, DVD's, books, etc. I found the service very friendly, even to an anglophone with just passable French. Zero attitude and it was fun to practice my French. Changerooms are really nice and spa-like, with one shower and lots of lockers (but you need to bring your own lock). They can provide towels at the reception area, although I don't know if there's a charge for that. \\n\\nThey have a busy schedule of several classes daily, so it's great because there's so much to choose from. I took the Hatha class on Saturday with Josianne and really enjoyed it. Although it was entirely in French, I could follow along (I agree with Velma - the amount of French you need is inversely proportional to how much background you have in yoga). Josianne was a patient teacher with attention to detail. I also tried the Shakti Flow class on Sunday with Marjorie. I didn't really enjoy it as much, but that was partly my own misunderstanding of what the class would be. I usually do Ashtanga and i thought it would be a similar flow or vinyasa-type class. Shakti flow is actually more like Nia, fusing some aspects of yoga with pilates or dance. There was a lot of hip circles and waving our arms with our eyes closed, and it wasn't much of a workout for me.  \\n\\nIt is expensive at $18/class, but I got the $20 weekly pass for newbies so that wasn't so bad. Mat rentals are $2. They also have a clinic in the basement for massages and other treatments. \\n\\nI would come back for yoga next time I am in Montreal, but I would stick to Hatha or Vinyasa classes instead of Shakti!"}

When you walk in, it's a pleasant environment and friendly check-in staff. After you sign in, you wait in comfy chairs until your masseuse calls you back. Each therapist has a copy of your chart showing your preferences and past experiences. They'll also ask you if you have any problem areas that need special attention. Then they'll step out of the room while you get ready for your treatment. \\n\\nMost of the masseuses will ask you about the pressure and your comfort. The massage table also has a built in heater, should you become cold. The lighting is soft and the music soothing. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a pretty awesome experience for $49 a month for your first massage and then $39 for any other massages you receive during that same month. They also have a family discount plan. If you need to use a different location, even out of state, your membership allows you to use the services of more than 600 Massage Envy locations nationwide."}

She told another associate right infront of me, that she only had a half hour and was going to have to hand me off in the middle of my scheduled appointment.  It took forever for her to pull the dresses.  Sadly the dresses were disappointing (the price was high and the gowns were just not great). I mentioned that I was interested in Lazaro.  The associate half-heartedly smiled and wouldn't show me the gown or any others for that matter.  She just said they weren't in my budget.  I joked that it's possible if the dress worked I could raise the bar- but she ignored me and that made me feel even worse.\\nWhen I left the store, I called my mom (who lives in Houston) in tears.

Literally at 7:01 AM the doorbell rang.  I had makeup done by Celina & hair by Courtney.  I had my m/u done first.  I showed her various pictures of what I was looking for and didnt look like any of the sample pictures, nor did I like my look at all.  I didn't get a good look at myself because right after she finished, I went to the hair chair.  It was only until after that I noticed that:\\na) my got tons of glue on my lower lashes\\nb) my foundation was uneven\\nc) my blush and eyeshadow weren't blended perfectly, so there were harsh lines\\nspectacular.  \\nd) some of my eyeliner was sparse and moving\\n\\nI did the airbrush foundation.  I didn't like it.  It looked like a lighter coverage that what I normally use and that's tinted moisturizer.  It didn't rub off on my clothes.\\n\\nMIT 702 makes strong claims about how they are the \\\"only\\\" co. that does a lot of things, so I want to be clear on what they do provide.\\n\\nThey offer a touch up to go kit.  This kit consists of a sponge for face, an eyeshadow applicator and a free lipgloss.  I don't use powder regularly and she recommended I use powder to keep my face looking good for so many hours, so I had to get my cousin to make a quick trip to sephora.  \\n\\nRegarding the lipgloss, it wasn't a color I would have chosen, but literally she had a dozen tubes of this \\\"universally flattering\\\" lipgloss that she gave to me, my mom & my mother-in-law.  My mom actually refused to wear it because she felt awkward having the same color as me & used her own lipstick instead.  The lipgloss definitely wasn't 15 hr proof, it was gone after I had my first glass of champagne in the limo & nonexistent in 90% of the pictures.\\n\\nAs for the lashes, I used my own because the ones they had were super long & looked too fake.  Re the lasting of the makeup, I was done at 10:15AM & got home just past midnight.  My eye makeup was still on, but had caked, my blush & foundation looked a bit sloppy.  I did have a long day, sweated, etc.\\n\\nMy mom hated her makeup.  She said that the one time I did her makeup looked a lot better than what they did.  I didn't think my mom looked any better than when she normally does her makeup (& she is hard of seeing).\\n\\nMy mother-in-law looked great.  Celina seemed hesitant to use lashes on her bc her natural lashes are so blond and she has light hair, but she was excited about them, so used them anyway.  She looked good.  She didn't look over the top or anything, a very natural look, which is similar to what she normally wears.  \\n\\nHair\\nMy mom has thinning hair & I had e-mailed ahead to let them know this.  She usually uses a product to add fullness and forgot it in NY.  I also emailed ahead about this.  The stylist (Courtney) emailed me back telling me to check out Sally's for the product but we didn't have enough time.  She did was she could, but unfortunately the product she had was grey and my mom had light brown hair with dark low lights.  Considering the circumstances, her hair looked good & held up throughout the day & night.  She wanted to add some brown, but the makeup artist said the only way would be to break an eyeshadow and she didn't want to do that because she didn't think it was worth it.  She also said this after going on about how she buys all types of things and writes them off on her taxes.  It isn't how I would have acted in her position, but completely understand her stance, though she could have been more professional in her wording & demeanor.\\n\\nDespite telling me she couldn't do my hair in the fashion that Megan had told me was a go, she still did a good job.  My hair held well throughout the day and I was able to work it a little into what I wanted for the night.\\n\\nMy mother in law's hair was fantastic.  She has beautiful, thick, luxurious & plentiful hair, so admittedly was a great canvas to work with, but her hair was great & lasted the entire day.\\n\\nMy only commentary regarding the hair is that we all had the same colored bobby pins used on us and given to us for \\\"touch ups,\\\" yet my mother in law has blond and red hair, my mother has light to medium brown hair and my hair is jet black.\\n\\nOverall, these girls were both on time, super chipper & friendly.  I would rate hair an A- and makeup a C, at best.  Another additional commentary is that Celina, the makeup artist was done before Courtney the stylist was done.  She collected the money & said she had a day full of bookings so had to be on the go.  This is why I wasn't able to point out issues with my makeup to her.  Courtney stayed about a good 30 mins after that.  I thought this was weird & unprofessional.  \\n\\nThey sent me emails to write reviews on wedding sites, when I did, the review was disputed, so beware of what may be a false positive in the rankings.

This experience was just not great from the moment we pulled into the parking lot. I didn't want to valet my car because the parking lot was right there, but I had to wait for someone to tell me where to park and they made me park way in the back, which I thought was pretty inconvenient. So you either have to valet even though it's unnecessary or park at the back of the lot. ok whatever. We get in and check in with the host, she tells my boyfriend happy birthday and asks us to go wait for a bit. The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I figured they were just setting the table up real quick. 10 min goes by and we get seated by the entrance, which wasn't the best place since everyone passes by there. There is a \\\"team\\\" that serves you rather than just one person so we had 4 people filling up our waters as soon after we would take a drink and everyone kept asking how things were going. it got pretty annoying. We ordered the fried calamari and bacon wrapped scallops for appetizers. the calamari wasn't anything fancy, it wasn't seasoned with anything and the sauce is regular tarter sauce, so we were pretty disappointed. (if you want crazy good calamari, you need to go try capital grill). The scallops were a good size and it was really good, but we've definitely had better. the scallops were on the dry side but tasted pretty good. for the entrees, I ordered their special surf and turf with a 6oz filet and lobster and my bf ordered their 14oz prime rib oscar style. 40 min passes and the food finally comes out, I cut into my steak and it's perfect medium rare and everything was very tasty. my boyfriend did not get his steak Oscar style as ordered so we had to have them take it back while we waited. Ribeye steaks are suppose to be really juicy and tender but his steak was tough and chewy and definitely not what we expected from a nice steakhouse. We really don't like to complain so he just ate it. They forgot my boyfriend's bday and never brought out his dessert so I had to ask and that's when one of the servers remembered. The server Colette was really the savior of the night and the only one that really made any sense there. the manager came by and asked how everything was going and apologized for all the hiccups throughout the night and said dessert was on him. they brought out an Oreo chocolate ice cream cake slice for the oops remedy and a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday treat. there were a lot of other weird interactions throughout the night that I don't want to take the time to type out but I've had way better service and food at other places and probably won't be coming back here."}

Despite reading the reviews about dirty rooms, we decided to go because location was great and it was cheap and got a good deal online -- WORST MISTAKE EVER. We got ROBBED while we were sleeping. Do not compromise your safety or the safety of your loved ones to save a few bucks on a room stay. Our room was locked, the thief must have had some other kind of access to the room because how else could you have gotten in? Valuables can be replaced, but we are lucky that the thief was not violent and attacked us because he had to have been in the room for several minutes before we woke up and realized he was in our room. Seriously, as a young female on a budget wanting to have a good time in Vegas, save your money and go somewhere safer!!!! Or sleep with pepper spray by your bed in case you too become a Quad room invasion victim!! You shouldn't have to sacrifice your safety because you get a good deal on a room! There are no security cameras in the hallways, so security was pretty much useless. \\n\\nI woke up and saw a man crouching at the doorway, we made eye contact before he grabbed our laptop bag and made a dash. I was able to see that he ran down the hall (of the 6th floor, in the Towers 1 & 2 area). He stole all our valuables wallets, and car keys. He tried to steal our car in the self-parking garage. We filed an incident report with hotel security, but from there on out we were shuffled to third party management agencies, were treated disrespectfully, they blamed the incident on us, and we have not been compensated for anything, even the room.\\n\\nIf it still matters...the room was dingy, the elevators seemed like they were going to break, the bathtubs don't drain well, it's a pretty long trek (especially if you're in heels) from the rooms to the lobby, the casino is small & run-down, it's super smoky compared to other casinos on the strip, and taxis don't come to this hotel as often, so you'll have a bit of a wait if you need one. Like I said, we didn't expect great accommodations, but getting robbed was pretty crappy and ridiculous.\\n\\nSave yourself a nightmare, and avoid!!"}

Unfortunately, that was the only good thing that I can remember. On the day of my appt, they were an hour and a half late. Then upon arrival, they didn't even have the correct equipment to do the job!!!! I have a dryer/washer stack combo and they couldn't move the machine! They simply stated that they checked the vent on the exterior of the building and  concluded that our vent was good to go for another 3 years. I wasn't around majority of the time of the service but despite not being able to do the job needed, they had charged us the full amount to do pretty much nothing. I could go on and on and in details about everything that happened but I won't. The thing I still don't understand is that being in the business of cleaning dryer vents, why did they not have the proper equipment to do the job?? Sure their prices seemed good but as for honesty, I wouldn't trust their judgement. I hired an honorable and awesome company to do the job after such terrible service and boy did they do a 200% better job!"}

We were seated right away with no judgments, which already was amazing, as I'd judged myself. haha!\\n\\nThe waiter LARRY was super nice; took our drink orders, and didn't question our strange appearances or bad accents. When asked where I was from, I panicked and confessed that we were just dorks having a fun family outing... He loved it, barked a laugh, admitted he thought the \\\"choo choo\\\" girl was kind of strange, and went on to have a great conversation with us.

It was a huge serving, so I took over half of it home with me, and cost less then $10! My daughter got the sampler plate with meatloaf, ham, and chicken & dumplings.... all 3 were delicious! Definitely not something you'd want to eat when counting calories, but we were on vacation, so it's ok. :p\\n\\nThe ambiance is super cute. Old antiques gave it the country vibe, tables were clean, and there were little games on the table you can play while you wait for dinner!

I had to look pretty hard to find this package but it was there, offered by the hotel on their website. I really like Las Vegas. But I don't like the long lines to register and the worn out rooms in the hotels on the Strip. I have a new hotel when I come here. The room is beautiful, a King bed with quality linens. Two comfortable chairs and a small lounge area. I rode the elevator up with the housekeeper for the floor and as we got off the elevator she said to me, \\\"Welcome the the Aliante. If you need anything, please call me and I will get it to you!\\\" OMG! OMG! After the fiasco at Fox Car Rentals I feel like I have arrived in paradise."}

They are filled with pork and vegies.\\n\\nTheir noodle soup, the duck and bbq pork is delicious as well.  I've tried Mama Woo's Spicy noodles soup too and it was great!"}

The unagi came out missing the the sauce and seaweed wrap.  The dynamite was burnt and didn't have any cream.  The garlic edamame was extremely burnt.   \\n\\nIt looked like the restaurant only had two servers. I felt bad for them at first but I didnt towards the end of the night. When we told them the problems with our food, they shrugged us off. On top of that the sushi chef gave my family a dirty look for voicing our concerns with the food. It was as if they were only interested in satisfying their customers at the sushi bar.  \\n\\nI dont think I will be back for a very long time. I'm not happy at all with the way my family was treated tonight.  Save your money and eat at a sushi bar that gives good service"}

The pad thai was not great, the noodles was too chewy. I thought it was undercooked. \\n\\nThe price is perfect, not that expensive for their lunch specials. BUT quality is just not that good for me."}

The large teriyaki chicken could feed 1 person full but wouldn't really be satisfying enough for two people. It's also a little strange to have such young children working the front desk. I mean that girl maybe was 13 and the boy maybe 9-10. Probably won't come back...."}
